If we create an observable we need to destroy that subscription or else there will be memory leakage and your app will 
run slow. 
How the memory leakage happens?
The subscription is emitting values on initialization of the component, but if the user move to another component still 
the value is being emitted in the background and when the user comes back to the component again another phase of value 
emission starts. Soon the app will run out of resource and it will run slow.
